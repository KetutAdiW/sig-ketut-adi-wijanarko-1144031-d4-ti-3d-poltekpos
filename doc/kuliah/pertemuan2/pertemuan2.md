The number of picture overview on the earth's surface that has existed it easier to find the information needed to see the picture of a picture of the earth's surface. The development of technology to make people easy to access and retrieve data or to download images of the earth's surface. Data data needed for use in a geographic information system should be based on the fact that there was at the time the data was taken. On a geographic information system data is retrieved data must be qualified and properly in accordance with the reality. Data on existing data on the geographic information system called spatial data, spatial data is divided into two vector data and raster data.
Explanations and solutions to problems
spatial data
Spatial data is referenced data on object representation of the object that is in the earth. Spatial data is usually based on a map that contains projections of phenomena on earth. Spatial data has two types of vector data and raster data.
vector Data
Vector data in the form of SHP or shapefiles. Namely in the form view using dots, lines, or curves and polygons. Polygon is a collection of interrelated list by using tittik / pointer. Vector data by vendor ESRI is divided into two, namely shp file format and .dbf. shp file format in the form of coordinates or point while .dbf file format in the form of a table or also as a database.
raster Data
Raster data displaying spatial data using pixels pixels that make up the grid. Raster data is commonly used in making such a map describing the state of soils, vegetation and soil moisture. In raster data the smaller the surface of the earth who represented the higher the resolution. In raster data the higher the image resolution, the bigger the file size.
We can obtain a picture of the earth's surface on a website that can be natural earth downoad appropriate scale desired. The larger the scale, the greater the file size. Examples of large scale is 1: 10m means that 1 centimeter on the map represents 10 million centi meters at actual size. There is a download option that is cultural, physical, and raster. Cultural includes a map of the country, borders, tribal population, airports, peabuhan, and others. Physical include an overview of the island ,, oceans, rivers, lakes, coral reefs and others. Raster covering the ocean floor, the shadow of relief, the authenticity of the earth, and others.
Conclusions and recommendations
In the vector data has a high spatial resolution, and more efficient storage space. While raster data requires a large storage space but has a simple data structure.
Suggestion
In using spatial data requires a match between the needs and efficiency in the use of vector data and raster data to maximize the function of each data.
